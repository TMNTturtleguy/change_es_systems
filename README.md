place script in /home/pi/RetroPie/retropiemenu/
 In order to run the script you must create the following folders:
    /opt/retropie/configs/all/emulationstation/es_systems
 Then within that folder create these 4 folders:
    All
    Consoles
    Customs
    Favorites
 Example of the full path: /opt/retropie/configs/all/emulationstation/es_systems/Favorites
 Within each folder you have created place a es_systems.cfg file. The file needs to be named the same in each folder, but the systems can be different.
 Restart EmulationStation Manually and the script is located in the retropie menu
