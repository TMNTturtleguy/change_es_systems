# TMNTturtlguy - June 2017
#
# place script in /home/pi/RetroPie/retropiemenu/
# In order to run the script you must create the following folders:
#    /opt/retropie/configs/all/emulationstation/es_systems
# Then within that folder create these 4 folders:
#    all
#    consoles
#    customs
#    favorites
# Example of the full path: /opt/retropie/configs/all/emulationstation/es_systems/favorites
# Within each folder you have created place a es_systems.cfg file. The file needs to be named the same in each folder, but the systems can be different.
# Restart EmulationStation and the script is located in the retropie menu
